Homework 5

You will create a program that will demonstrate the use of containers.

Expand on the Enemy_Polymorphism_Example code to create a set of classes for a
player's party.

Create at least three character types that override a base class's virtual
function(s).

In Main, work with this new hierarchy of classes to create a container of
pointers of the base class, then call into the overriding functions.

EXTRA CREDIT: 10 points

When you have generated both an enemy party and a player party, have them fight
until one party is victorious.

Use polymorphism to control each party's actions.
This is free form, so any implementation that runs and works will get credit.
