Lab 7

You will create a program that will demonstrate the use of containers.

Create a program that allows the user to enter any amount of integers into a
vector.

Have them repeat this process 4 times for separate vectors – 5 total vectors
storing any amount of integers in each vector.

Once this is done, use the vector function shrink_to_fit to fit each vector to
the size of its elements.

After completing this, use one of the member functions included with vector to
save its total size to a priority_queue. Then output the contents of that
priority_queue using an appropriate iterator.

The output should display the size of the largest vector, then second largest,
then third largest, then fourth largest, and finally fifth largest.
