(Payroll System Modification)

Modify the payroll system of Figs. 13.9 - 13.17 to include private data member
birthDate in class Employee.

Use class Date from Figs. 11.6 - 11.7 to represent an employee's birthday.

Assume that payroll is processed once per month.

Create a vector of Employee references to store the various employee objects.

In a loop,calculate the payroll for each Employee (polymorphically), and add a
$100.00 bonus to the person's payroll amount if the current month is the month
in which the Employee's birthday occurs.
