Lab 5

You will create a program that will demonstrate inheritance.

Create a base class called HousePet. A HousePet should have a name, species,
height, and weight.

It should also contain methods to set and get those values. The constructor
should initialize those values.

You will create two derived classes using HousePet as a base class. These
classes are up to you, but should be named according to what type of house pet
it is (ex: cat, dog, fish, house elf, etc.).

Work under the idea that you’re trying to define classes for a house pet.
Include data members and methods that make sense for your derived classes,
including setters and getters.

Create a driver program that creates your house pets and tells the user about
them.
