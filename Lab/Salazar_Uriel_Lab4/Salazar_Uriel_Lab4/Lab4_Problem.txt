Lab 4

You will create a program that contains a class called MailingLabel.

MailingLabel should be able to store each piece of information that is commonly
found on a mailing label in separate data members.

MailingLabel should also have two friend functions that overload the stream
insertion and stream extraction operators.

The overloaded stream extraction operator should be able to accept a full
mailing label from the user and correctly store that data into the MailingLabel
object.

The stream insertion operator should be able to output the data members in
MailingLabel, formatted in the style of:

Name
BuildingNumber, StreetName, StreetSuffix,
City, State, ZipCode5#-ZipCode4#

Create a driver program that demonstrates your overloaded operators are working
correctly with user input.
